# Overleave

Hot reload extension for Overleaf to use the text editor and PDF compiler in different windows.

This project is a Chrome extension that, when in an Overleaf project, opens the compiled pdf in a new tab. I built this because I prefer the local TeX experience where I can typeset in one window and leave the compiled pdf in another window; however, Overleaf doesn't have this functionality.

## Key Features:

* Split view for multiple Windows.
